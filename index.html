As a recognized California Distinguished School and a National Certificate for STEM Excellence School, I will continue to pave the path for all our students to attain academic success yearly and gain 21st Century Skills that will prepare them to be college and career ready.
 
My career in education, spans from teaching in the classroom, to working as an instructional leader, as well as being an administrator for affiliated charter schools.  I possess 15 years of educational experience with the Los Angeles Unified School District, mainly in grades TK-5 with a specific concentration in literacy development, Mathematics Shifts in Common Core Standards, technology, and early enrichment opportunities for children. I have a Master’s Degree in Education of Administration and I am elated to bring my skills as an educational leader to AES, where I'm excited to be working with you as a partner in education, to help ensure your child's success this year!
 
As we begin our journey together, my number one priority is to reach our academic and safety goals.  I will assure that resources and interventions are in place for the year, so that our culturally diverse learners and Special Education populations advance in both ELA and Math.  I will invest in providing technological resources for our students to gain 21st Century Skills in all content areas. To establish a positive and safe environment for all our staff and students, I will develop a Safe School-Wide Positive Behavior Support program that will build teams and administrative supports. 
 
As principal my door will always remain open and your input is always welcomed.  I will support the district goal of making families and communities our partners to help us grow as a school. 

​Please feel free to contact me to discuss any concerns, suggestions or ideas to help make this the best year yet!
 
Sincerely,
Judy Carrillo
Principal of Academy for Enriched Sciences
